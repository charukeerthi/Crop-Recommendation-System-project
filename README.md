# Introduction

Crop Recommender System is a Machine learning project. This project runs on Flask for the Front-end display. Python is used to build a machine learning model for recommending the most suitable crop to grow, fertilizer to use, and identifying the plant disease using the model.

# Technology

- Language : `Python`
- Frameworks : `TensorFlow, PyTorch`
- Frontend Software : `Flask`
- User Interface Design : `Python, JavaScript`
- ML Algorithms used : `Random Forest, CNN`

# How to run the Crop Recommender System project

1. Download the file

2. Go to _Crop-Recommendation-System-project\app\_ path

3. Type `cmd` to open the command prompt

4. Type `Python app.py` in the command prompt to open the Flask website.

Note: Be sure to install the _requirements.txt_ at _Crop-Recommendation-System-project\requirements.txt_ before running the `python` command.

# Module
Crop Recommender System has 4 modules. They are Home, Crop, Fertilizer, Disease

- _Home_ - This page consist about us and about the services we provide.

- _Crop_ - In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.

- _Fertilizer_ - For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements.

- _Disease_ - For the plant disease application, that is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.
